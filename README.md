    <h1>Tic Tac Toe C Program</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in C. The game allows two players to take turns and compete against each other. The program keeps track of the number of games played and displays the results at the end.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Compile and Run</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open your preferred C compiler (e.g., GCC) in your terminal.</li>
        <li>Compile the source code by running the following command:<br>
            <code>gcc tic_tac_toe.c -o tic_tac_toe</code>
        </li>
        <li>Run the compiled executable:<br>
            <code>./tic_tac_toe</code>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The game is played on a 3x3 grid.</li>
        <li>Player 'X' starts the game, and players take turns placing their 'X' or 'O' on the grid.</li>
        <li>To make a move, enter the row number (from 1 to 3) and the column number (from 1 to 3) when prompted.</li>
        <li>The game continues until one player wins or all 9 grid positions are filled.</li>
        <li>A player wins by getting three of their symbols in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Scoring</h2>
    <p>
        After each game, the program will display the result. It keeps track of the number of games played and how many times 'X' and 'O' have won. The results are displayed at the end of each session.
    </p>
